# [ Neo4j ] Relational Databases vs. Graph Databases

Until now, I had only used relational databases (RDB), especially MySQL. But recently, I had an opportunity to work with a NoSQL database for the first time.

While relational databases are convenient for managing small-scale data, NoSQL databases are often more efficient when handling large-scale or complex data, especially when the data doesn't fit neatly into tables.

In a previous project, I planned to use MongoDB but couldnâ€™t due to other issues. So this time, Iâ€™m taking the chance to explore NoSQL databasesâ€”especially Neo4jâ€”and document my findings.

## ðŸ“š Key Differences Between Relational and Graph Databases

| Relational Database       | Graph Database                        |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Uses SQL queries          | Uses Cypher queries                    |
| Table-based structure     | Node and Relationship-based structure  |
| Composed of rows and columns | Nodes and relationships with properties |
| Rigid schema              | Flexible data modeling                 |

### âœ… Relational Databases

Relational databases store data in tables using a query language called SQL.  
Each table is composed of rows (records) and columns (fields), where:
- Each row represents an individual data entry
- Each column represents an attribute or feature of that data

They are structured, consistent, and well-suited for applications where data relationships are simple and tabular.

### âœ… Graph Databases

Graph databases store data using nodes and relationships.  
- **Nodes** represent entities  
- **Relationships** represent the connections between entities  
- Both nodes and relationships can have **properties**

This structure is more intuitive for modeling real-world relationships and allows for highly flexible and expressive data modeling.

### ðŸ”Ž Example of Nodes and Relationships in Neo4j

```
(Alice)-[:FRIENDS_WITH]->(Bob)
```

- `Alice`, `Bob`: Nodes (entities)  
- `FRIENDS_WITH`: Relationship (link between entities)  
- You can also add additional properties to both nodes and relationships (e.g., age, registration date)

Traditional RDBs require restructuring data to fit into predefined formats. As the volume of data increases, this can lead to complexity and reduced clarity.

In contrast, **graph databases** model data in a way that reflects real-world relationships, making them more **intuitive** and **flexible**, even for non-experts.
