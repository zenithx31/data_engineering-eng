# ðŸ“š Example: Scraping a Telegram Chat Using Telethon

Make sure Python and pip are installed on your system.  
Then, install the required libraries:

```bash
$ pip install pandas
$ pip install telethon
```

```python
import pandas as pd
from telethon import TelegramClient

# Insert your API ID, hash, and the chat link to scrape messages
name = 'test'
api_id = '<api_id>'
api_hash = '<api_hash>'
chat = '<chat_link>'

data = []

# Connect to the Telegram server
async def some_function():
    async with TelegramClient(name, api_id, api_hash) as client:
        async for message in client.iter_messages(chat):
            data.append([message.sender_id, message.text])

df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['SENDER', 'MESSAGE'])
df.to_csv('test.csv', encoding='utf-8')
```

The example above asynchronously fetches messages from a specified Telegram chat using Telethon.  
Fetched messages are stored in a DataFrame and exported to a CSV file using `to_csv()`.
